## Student Information
- **Name:** [Your Name Here]
- **University Registration Number:** [Your Registration Number Here]

## Project Description
This project visually implements the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using the Expectation-Maximization Baum-Welch algorithm. The core objective of the algorithm is to estimate unknown model parameters (Initial probabilities, Transition probabilities, and Emission probabilities) solely from observation sequences.

## Features
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Powered by Vanilla Javascript with modern, glassmorphic UI via HTML/CSS.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Real-time evaluation of `Alpha` (Forward), `Beta` (Backward), and `Gamma` (State Responsibilities) probability matrices.
- **Iterative Updates**: Step-by-step Expectation-Maximization iterations.

## How to Run it locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. No installation or backend server required.
3. Configure **Model Setup** and hit **Initialize Model Form**.
4. Provide an observation sequence and run iterations to observe the probability flow recalculations.
