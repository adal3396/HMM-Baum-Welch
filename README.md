# Hidden Markov Model - Baum-Welch Algorithm

## Student Information
- **Name:** Adal Seju
- **University Registration Number:** TCR24CS004

## Project Description
This project visually implements the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using the Expectation-Maximization Baum-Welch algorithm. The core objective of the algorithm is to estimate unknown model parameters (Initial probabilities, Transition probabilities, and Emission probabilities) solely from observation sequences.

## Features
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Powered by Vanilla Javascript with modern, glassmorphic UI via HTML/CSS.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Real-time evaluation of `Alpha` (Forward), `Beta` (Backward), and `Gamma` (State Responsibilities) probability matrices.
- **Iterative Updates**: Step-by-step Expectation-Maximization iterations.
